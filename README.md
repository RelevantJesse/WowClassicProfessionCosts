# FrugalForge (Anniversary) — In‑Game Profession Leveling Planner

FrugalForge is a single‑addon solution for Classic/Anniversary that scans Auction House prices, tracks owned
materials, and generates a full profession leveling plan entirely in‑game. No web app, no import/export.

## ✅ Key Features

- All‑in‑game planning
Build targets, scan prices, capture owned mats, and generate a plan without leaving WoW.
- Auction House scanner
Uses the legacy AH browse API (QueryAuctionItems) with exact‑name searches for reliable pricing.
- Owned materials support
Pulls inventory from BagBrother (Bagnon) and subtracts what you already own.
- Crafting intermediates
Automatically expands craftable reagents (e.g., settings, bolts, wire) so you don’t buy things you can make.
- Clear shopping list
Shows item names, quantities needed, owned counts, and total costs.
- Debug tools
/frugal debug opens a selectable modal with detailed info for troubleshooting.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Build Targets
Open /frugal, pick your profession, set skill range, click Build Targets.
2. Scan Auction House
Go to the AH and run /frugalscan start (or click Scan AH).
3. Capture Owned Mats
Run /frugalscan owned to record your inventory (requires BagBrother).
4. Generate Plan
Click Generate Plan to get:
- Step‑by‑step recipe plan
- Intermediate crafts (if any)
- Shopping list with prices

## 📦 Requirements

- WoW Classic Anniversary
- BagBrother (Bagnon) for owned material tracking
(Addon still works without it, but owned counts will be “unknown”)
