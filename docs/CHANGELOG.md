## 1.0.0 - 2026-02-04

- Non-trainer recipes are de-prioritized and called out as recipe-required in the plan/shopping list.
- Plan generation now blocks when any required price is missing, with a prompt to scan first.
- Scan Missing can derive missing items directly from targets without a plan.
- Intermediate craft lines insert before first use and show total-needed with current owned.
- Improved addon version lookup and README cleanup.
